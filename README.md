## Distros Framework - Acceptance Tests

The acceptance tests are a customizable way to create clusters and perform validations on them such that the requirements of specific features and functions can be validated.

- It relies on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provide the underlying cluster configuration.
- It uses [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) as assertion framework.

See `docs/` for any more specific information and examples.
