### Cert Rotate tests Setup Requirements/Assumptions

We need a split role setup for this test:
1 Etcd ONLY node
1 Control Plane ONLY node
1 Agent node

To set this up, please use the following in the tfvars file: 

```
no_of_server_nodes = 0  # This is for all roles server - etcd + control plane
no_of_worker_nodes = 1  # Agent node
split_roles        = true
etcd_only_nodes    = 1  # etcd only node count
etcd_cp_nodes      = 0 
etcd_worker_nodes  = 0
cp_only_nodes      = 1  # control plane only node count
cp_worker_nodes    = 0
# Numbers 1-6 correspond to: all-roles (1), etcd-only (2), etcd-cp (3), etcd-worker (4), cp-only (5), cp-worker (6).
role_order         = "2,5"
```

The role_order determines the order of nodes in the server ip array that will get returned in the factory cluster object. 
server1 -> etcd only
server2 -> control plane only
agent1 ->  agent/worker node

Note/TODO: k3s external db fails working with etcd only node. Refer: https://docs.k3s.io/datastore/ha

### Dual-Stack Testing

- Required vars for `*.tfvars` file
- `kubelet-arg: \n - node-ip=0.0.0.0` is needed if the public and private IPs are same

```
enable_public_ip     = true
enable_ipv6          = true
server_flags         = "cluster-cidr: <ipv4-cluster-cidr>,<ipv6-cluster-cider>\nservice-cidr: <ipv4-service-cidr>,<ipv6-service-cidr>\nkubelet-arg: \n - node-ip=0.0.0.0\n"
no_of_bastion_nodes  = 1
bastion_subnets      = "<dual-stack-subnet>"

```
- Test package should be `dualstack`
- Split roles is not supported at this time (Future enhancement)
- Reorder IP is not supported at this time (Future enhancement)
